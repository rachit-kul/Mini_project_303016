## Challenges Faced and how it was overcome

No | Challenge Faced | How it was overcome
---|-----------------|---------------------
1  |Understanding the need/requirement of number system conversion|Researched how heavily it is used in digital systems and in the day to day functioning of our personal computers
2  |Understanding the test cases to break the function | Figuring out the invalid inputs to the function
3 | Github Workflow Issues  | Went through resources present on Futureskills and youtube to fix it
